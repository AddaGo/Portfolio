        <div class="desc">
            We set off to create a digital platform product for a supposed client, UKCinemas, needing to adapt to the Dutch market as it was just entering it. We conducted research, gathered insights and made our way from finding our client's problems to delivering a product to solve them.

            <div class="stepcinema hvr-underline-from-left"> Case Description </div>
            <p style="color:#a7a7a7; opacity:1;">
                We received the case description stating the problem we were to solve through our design and introducing the client and its needs. The client was UKCinemas, a fictional client who was to represent a cinema company, very popular in the UK, trying to enter the Dutch market and change their approach to better fit this new market.
                <br> <br> <span style="color:#f2f2f2; font-weight: 600;"> The Goal was to help the client have an appropriate approach for the Dutch market and focus on their audience needs when designing the website of the digital platform. </span>
            </p>


            <div class="stepcinema hvr-underline-from-left"> Along the way </div>

            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Design Brief </div>
            <p>
                Starting the process, we have put together a design brief, letting the client know what our deliverable will be and making an agreement with them through this so both parties would agree to the initial statements before jumping in the research phase (being a fictional client, the purpose of the brief was getting used to its format and going through the right process when working with the client even though, in this case there was no second party to respond to this agreement).
            </p>


            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; User needs and stories </div>
            <p>
                Formulating user stories based on the needs we identified in different stages was an important part of keeping on track with th eprocess of solving the problem, which was our end goal, and not lose it out of sight. After finishing every step of research, we would go back on the user stories that we had so far and tweak them, add or remove some to match our current findings. The audience was our focus in the process of making the website, we had to not take our eyes off of it and user stories was the way we managed that.

            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Task analysis </div>
            <p>
                In the early stage of the process we gathered all the potential variables of the going to the cinema experience in order for us to understand all the phases our users go through from deciding a movie to actually going to see it. We wrote down all the actors(people or systems) and use cases(situations) to keep track of what makes up this experience.

            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideating </div>
            <p>
                We have formulated 3 "How might we" questions: one related to how we could improve the experience of buying snacks, another for how to develop the social aspect of being a movie enthusiast and part of a community and the last one about ways of improving transportation.
                <br> <br> For the ideating process, we used 6-3-5 method, having one row per person, completing it with ideas and then the next row being written by another one of us based as much as possible on the previously mentioned ideas. Once the process was done, we dotvoted our favourite ideas and kept those in mind going further, closer to the actual design phase.

            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; How users think? </div>
            <p>
                In order to understand how people expect the structure of a cinema site to be, we prepared a few cards naming different movie genres and did testing on people we knew, without giving them any context. They were asked to sort them in a way that made sense for them. We took the results and combined them, analysing how users might want to have the website structured. This way, we came up with a slightly unique method of organizing the way to find movies on our website.

            <div class="stepcinema" style="font-size: 1.5vw;"> STEP 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; Bringing structure </div>
            <p>
                The final steps before jumping into Figma to prototype this website were to establish the structure of the website itself in terms of navigation. We used a flowchart and a sitemap to do this and visualize the ways our users would go around the website pages. We also went into extreme detail on the buying a ticket process and used a flowchart to see all the steps needed and all the decisions that our user was going to to be asked to make.
