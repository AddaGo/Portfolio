        <h2> BMW USER INTERFACE </h2>
        <div class="subtitlebmw"> An UI with both the usability and the aesthetics. </div>

        <div class="desc">
            Reimagining the BMW website interface was a challenge for myself as a designer to preserve the brand's most valued features and create an aesthetically pleasing product. I aimed at satisfying both the first time user and the enthusiast. The first category I concluded would appreciate it being straightforward and easy to use while the latter would like to be shown the same boldness in the digital environment as they like in the cars.

            <div class="stepbmw"> CONTEXT </div>
                <p> Having been into cars and automotive industry my entire life, I took on the challenge to put my design vision into a BMW website prototype since BMW and design are two huge parts of myself. I checked the official website and grabbed some features that were essential for the site functionality. I then showcased them in the prototype in a more design oriented way, with more typography and visuals.</p>
            <br>

            <div class="showcase">
                <img src="images/ui1.jpg">
                <div class="imageexplanation"> Grid showcase to present in a visually pleasing manner the different car series available at BMW. Having some short description to match is meant to give the user a more clear view of what lies beyond the mouse click. This section is created for the buyers and directs them to the currently available models from the series. </div>
                <br> 

                <img src="images/ui2.jpg">
                <div class="imageexplanation"> This section was created for the nostalgic fans, consisting of a scrollable showcase of previous models that BMW produced, all time classics.  </div>
                <br>

                <img src="images/ui3.jpg">
                <div class="imageexplanation"> Technical specifications for the desired models so the user can get to know the cars better under the hood and asess their performance.  </div>
                <br>

                <img src="images/ui4.jpg">
                <br> <br>
            </div>

            <div class="stepbmw"> CONCLUSION </div>
            <p> This was the final product, having done frames for the landing page, a section for the buyers, one for the nostalgic fans, one for the technical specifications of the desired models and the final for the site footer. I used resources to best resemble the official website vibe and assembled it as my first User Interface project.
