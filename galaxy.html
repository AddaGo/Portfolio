        <h2> GALAXY WITHIN POSTERS </h2>
        <div class="subtitle"> A visual representation of the human personalities. </div>
        <div class="desc">
            <p> These posters were the product of an idea to turn the personalities of the people around me into abstract visual representations. I came up with a poster for somebody that is fairly quiet most of the time but unleashes their creativity and pleasure of talking and sharing knowledge only when people seem to care. The other poster is made for people that think they have everything in order, calmly settled, but actually live in an organized chaos.</p>
