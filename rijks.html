        <div class="step hvr-float"> STEP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Getting familiar with the website </div>
        <p> As a team we set out to discover the website and its functionalities and write down our assumptions to know how to formulate our tasks for the users further. We discovered some usability issues both from the UX perspective and as first time users since none of us came in contact with the site before this project. </p>

        <div class="imageexplanation">
            We assumed the features we will find on the site at specific points and then confirmed our assumptions by meeting the site ourselves for the first time.

        <br> <br>

        <div class="step hvr-float"> STEP 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Making step by step protocol </div>
        <p> We put together a step by step protocol that each of us needed to stick to for the research phase with their user. Anybody following the protocol would be able to conduct the same research as we did. </p>
        <br>

        <div class="step hvr-float"> STEP 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Gathering data </div>
        <p> Each of us set out to gather data in a familiar setting with their user with the help of another teammate for note-taking and better conducting the research. We recorded our users clicks and mouse movement while they were conducting the tasks and also interviewed them to gather their opinion on how usable the site seemed. </p>

        <div class="step hvr-float"> STEP 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Analysis </div>
        <p> After putting together the data we have all gathered, we started interpreting it to establish the general issues the website was found to have.  </p>

        <br> <br>

        <div class="step hvr-float"> Conclusion </div>
        <p> Most of the usability issues found were due to buttons being misplaced or buttons that took the user into an unpredictable location (such as the back button not taking you to the previously visited page). 
            <br> <br> We ended our research by filling a research journal with all of our findings and a thorough explanation for each of them and some suggestions for what we believe would make the site easier to use at the first glance. </p>
