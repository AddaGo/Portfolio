        <h2> PROTOTYPING FOR HALLMARK </h2>
        <div class="subtitlehallmark hvr-underline-from-center-hall"> Enhancing the gift giving experience with Hallmark </div>
        <br> 

        <div class="desc">
            We had the Hallmark company as a client for this project, aiming at showing them innovative ideas for their services from an UX point of view. The experience was aimed at the making gifts over distance service that one division of Hallmark provides.

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> STEP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Discover what our client values most </div>
            <p> We have done research on the website to figure out the visuals preffered by the Hallmark company and get to know what they offer and what they value in the experience they provide. We wanted to preserve that in the prototype we were going to create. </p>
            <br>

                <img src="images/hallmarkmeet.png">
            </div>

            <div class="imageexplanation">
                The site has a lightweight way of presenting the information with light colours and playful visuals. We decided to preserve the playful, easy to scan and understand way of making the visuals.
            </div>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> STEP 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Get to know our users </div>
            <p> This project had the "BESPOKE" title. We aimed the experience at only one user who had the role of the receiver. We did our entire research on one person each and then combined them into a persona from both of the users. 
                <br> <br>
            We interviewed the user, observed them with their friends, observed their reaction when we gave them a gift based on what we knew about them from the interview phase and put all the data together and assembled it into insights about their personality, hobbies and likings when receiving a gift. </p>
            <br>

            <div class="showcase-project">
                <img src="images/portrait.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class="imageexplanation">
                I put together an user portrait for my individual user which was then combined with my teammate's and lead to the final portrait used in the ideation phase. This one summarizes all the findings about my user from the interviewing and observation parts.
            </div>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> STEP 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Coming up with diverse ideas </div>
            <p> The diverging phase came in next where we got to come up with as many ideas as we could to match the insights we had on the persona. We used diverging techniques such as HMW questions which we used to also engage our colleagues in the ideation phase and get as many ideas as possible. </p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 0;"> Our experience had to be based on keywords such as winter sports, musical background and close family. We discovered that our user had a musical background, everyone in the family was a singer, and they used to practice snowboarding since childhood. </p>
            <div class="contact" style="padding-top: 0; margin: 0;">
                <img src="images/snow.png">

                <img src="images/music.png">
                <img src="images/mountains.png">
            </div>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> STEP 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Choosing the final concept </div>
            <p> We converged upon the ideas that we managed to come up with and chose our final design concept that we then started prototyping. The concept was centered around having a card personalized with a voice message such as the family singing and the unwrapping was made around an obstacle course mobile game in which the player has to not crash and collect all the puzzle pieces that then make the gift. </p>
            <br>

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> STEP 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Preparing for client pitch </div>
            <p> For the client pitch we set out to create some deliverables that would sum up the experience we created and what it was based on. Besides preparing our speech and making sure to emphasize the key elements of our design, we also created a broader experience to engage them into our story.
            <br> <br> One part of it was an Instagram AR filter that included the element of winter sports and would bring the viewer of our pitch closer to our designed experience and overall story. </p>
            
            <p> Another element to make the pitch more engaging was a flyer with one side dedicated to the winter element of the design and the other with the musical aspect that was also very strong. </p>
            <div class="showcase-project">
                <img src="images/flyer1.jpg" style="width:100%">
                <br> <br>
                <img src="images/flyer2.jpg" style="width:100%">
            </div>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark hvr-float"> Conclusion </div>
            <p> The idea to design a bespoke experience for one single user allowed us to think every detail thoroughly and really focus on the prototyping more than the struggle to fit with the target user groups (since there wasn't any). It was also my first client pitch and looking back I think my team did a great job at presenting the key items and ways of bringing value to Hallmark, which was exactly what we set out to achieve. </p>
