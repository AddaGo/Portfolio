        <div class="project-intro" style="margin-top:2vw;">
            Hallmark specializes in making gift giving, even over distance, an amazing engaging experience and we set out to improve that in an unconventional and bespoke way through this concept.

            <div class="stephallmark"> Case description </div>
            <p> The client needed a concept design for making a bespoke experience of gift giving over distance. We have done research on the website to figure out the visuals preffered by the Hallmark company and get to know what they offer and what they value in the experience they provide. We wanted to preserve that in the prototype we were going to create. </p>

            <div class="stephallmark"> Research process </div>
            <p> This project had the "BESPOKE" title. We aimed the experience at only one user who had the role of the receiver. We interviewed the user, observed them with their friends, observed their reaction when we gave them a gift based on what we knew about them from the interview phase and put all the data together and assembled it into insights about their personality, hobbies and likings when receiving a gift. </p>
            <br>

            <div class="showcase-project">
                <img src="images/hallmarkframe1.jpg">
            </div>

            
            <div class="stephallmark"> Concept drafting and user journey </div>
            <p> The concept was centered around having a card personalized with a voice message such as the family singing and the unwrapping was made around an obstacle course mobile game in which the player has to not crash and collect all the puzzle pieces that then make the gift. The entire process is split in two parts: the process of the sender and the one of the receiver, having completely different tasks, yet coming together into an immersive gifting experience. </p>

            <div class="stephallmark"> Pitching to the client </div>
            <p> For the client pitch we created deliverables to sum up the experience we created and what it was based on. Besides preparing our speech and making sure to emphasize the key elements of our design, we also created a broader experience to engage them into our story. We prototyped an Instagram AR filter with the winter sports theme and flyers to make the entire concept explanation easy to understand and memorable in just a few seconds. </p>

            <div class="stephallmark"> Conclusion </div>
            <p> The idea to design a bespoke experience for one single user allowed us to think every detail thoroughly, which has been both an upside in the sense of matching the user needs specifically, and a downside in making it a challenge to have it applicable for a larger audience by our client. It was also my first client pitch and, looking back, I believe my team and I have done a great job at bringing value to Hallmark. </p>
