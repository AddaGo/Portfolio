        <h2> PROTOTYPING FOR HALLMARK </h2>
        <div class="subtitlehallmark"> Enhancing the gift giving experience with Hallmark </div>
        <br> 

        <div class="desc">
            We had the Hallmark company as a client for this project, aiming at showing them innovative ideas for their services from an UX point of view. The experience was aimed at the making gifts over distance service that one division of Hallmark provides.

            <div class="stephallmark"> STEP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Discover what our client values most </div>
            <p> We have done research on the website to figure out the visuals preffered by the Hallmark company and get to know what they offer and what they value in the experience they provide. We wanted to preserve that in the prototype we were going to create. </p>
            <br>

            </div>

            <div class="imageexplanation">
                The site has a lightweight way of presenting the information with light colours and playful visuals. We decided to preserve the playful, easy to scan and understand way of making the visuals.
            </div>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark"> STEP 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Get to know our users </div>
            <p> This project had the "BESPOKE" title. We aimed the experience at only one user who had the role of the receiver. We did our entire research on one person each and then combined them into a persona from both of the users. 
                <br> <br>
            We interviewed the user, observed them with their friends, observed their reaction when we gave them a gift based on what we knew about them from the interview phase and put all the data together and assembled it into insights about their personality, hobbies and likings when receiving a gift. </p>
            <br>

            <div class="showcase-project">

            </div>

            <div class="imageexplanation">
                I put together an user portrait for my individual user which was then combined with my teammate's and lead to the final portrait used in the ideation phase. This one summarizes all the findings about my user from the interviewing and observation parts.

            <br> <br>

            <div class="stephallmark"> STEP 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Coming up with diverse ideas </div>
            <p> The diverging phase came in next where we got to come up with as many ideas as we could to match the insights we had on the persona. We used diverging techniques such as HMW questions which we used to also engage our colleagues in the ideation phase and get as many ideas as possible. </p>
            
            <p style="padding-bottom: 0;"> Our experience had to be based on keywords such as winter sports, musical background and close family. We discovered that our user had a musical background, everyone in the family was a singer, and they used to practice snowboarding since childhood. </p>
